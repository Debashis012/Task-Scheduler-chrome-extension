# Task-Scheduler-chrome-extension
Created a task management Chrome extension with JavaScript, Chrome APIs, and Google Calendar API. Users can schedule, update, and delete tasks. Used Chromeâ€™s local storage for data persistence, and integrated notifications that are sent to any device where the same Google account is logged in.
